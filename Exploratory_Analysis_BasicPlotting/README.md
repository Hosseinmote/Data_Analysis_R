# Basic Plotting in R

The goal in this project is to analyze data and make some exploratory plots using R base plotting system.
The data is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. In particular, we will be using the 
“Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” generated by Roger D. Peng during a coursera course of "Exploratory data analysis with R".

This repo contains 4 R files and a HTML R notebook. For complete description of the data and R codes please refer to the "Codebook_ExploratoryPlots.html"
As a part of the project, I have created a set of 4 R files which can be used to reproduce plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, and plo4.png.

1. generating_hist_plot1 : created a histogram in plot1.png using the histogram command.
2. generating_plotfunc_plot2 : created a single plot in plot2.png using plot function.
3. generating_overlayingplots_plot3: created multiple plot on top of each other in plot3.png using plot and lines commands.
4. generating_subplots_plot4: created 4 subplots in plot4.png using mfrow and plot commands.
